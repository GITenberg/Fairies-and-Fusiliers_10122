<a name="critic"></a><h2>TO AN UNGENTLE CRITIC</h2>
<p><i>The great sun sinks behind the town<br />
Through a red mist of Volnay wine....</i><br />
But what's the use of setting down<br />
That glorious blaze behind the town?<br />
You'll only skip the page, you'll look<br />
For newer pictures in this book;<br />
You've read of sunsets rich as mine.</p>
<p><i>A fresh wind fills the evening air<br />
With horrid crying of night birds....</i><br />
But what reads new or curious there<br />
When cold winds fly across the air?<br />
You'll only frown; you'll turn the page,<br />
But find no glimpse of your &quot;New Age<br />
Of Poetry&quot; in my worn-out words.</p>
<p>Must winds that cut like blades of steel<br />
And sunsets swimming in Volnay,<br />
The holiest, cruellest pains I feel,<br />
Die stillborn, because old men squeal<br />
For something new: &quot;Write something new:<br />
We've read this poem&mdash;that one too,<br />
And twelve more like 'em yesterday&quot;?</p>
<p>No, no! my chicken, I shall scrawl<br />
Just what I fancy as I strike it,<br />
Fairies and Fusiliers, and all<br />
Old broken knock-kneed thought will crawl<br />
Across my verse in the classic way.<br />
And, sir, be careful what you say;<br />
There are old-fashioned folk still like it.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="oldman"></a><h2>AN OLD TWENTY-THIRD MAN</h2>
<p>&quot;Is that the Three-and-Twentieth, Strabo mine,<br />
Marching below, and we still gulping wine?&quot;<br />
From the sad magic of his fragrant cup<br />
The red-faced old centurion started up,<br />
Cursed, battered on the table. &quot;No,&quot; he said,<br />
&quot;Not that! The Three-and-Twentieth Legion's<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">dead,</span><br />
Dead in the first year of this damned campaign&mdash;<br />
The Legion's dead, dead, and won't rise again.<br />
Pity? Rome pities her brave lads that die,<br />
But we need pity also, you and I,<br />
Whom Gallic spear and Belgian arrow miss,<br />
Who live to see the Legion come to this,<br />
Unsoldierlike, slovenly, bent on loot,<br />
Grumblers, diseased, unskilled to thrust or shoot.<br />
O, brown cheek, muscled shoulder, sturdy<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">thigh!</span><br />
Where are they now? God! watch it struggle<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">by,</span><br />
The sullen pack of ragged ugly swine.<br />
Is that the Legion, Gracchus? Quick, the<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">wine!&quot;</span><br />
&quot;Strabo,&quot; said Gracchus, &quot;you are strange tonight.<br />
The Legion is the Legion; it's all right.<br />
If these new men are slovenly, in your thinking,<br />
God damn it! you'll not better them by drinking.<br />
They all try, Strabo; trust their hearts and hands.<br />
The Legion is the Legion while Rome stands,<br />
And these same men before the autumn's fall<br />
Shall bang old Vercingetorix out of Gaul.&quot;</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="lucasta"></a><h2>TO LUCASTA ON GOING TO THE WAR&mdash;FOR THE FOURTH TIME</h2>
<p>It doesn't matter what's the cause,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">What wrong they say we're righting,</span><br />
A curse for treaties, bonds and laws,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">When we're to do the fighting!</span><br />
And since we lads are proud and true,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">What else remains to do?</span><br />
Lucasta, when to France your man<br />
Returns his fourth time, hating war,<br />
Yet laughs as calmly as he can<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.25em;">And flings an oath, but says no more,</span><br />
That is not courage, that's not fear&mdash;<br />
Lucasta he's a Fusilier,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And his pride sends him here.</span>
</p>
<p>Let statesmen bluster, bark and bray,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And so decide who started</span><br />
This bloody war, and who's to pay,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">But he must be stout-hearted,</span><br />
Must sit and stake with quiet breath,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Playing at cards with Death.</span><br />
Don't plume yourself he fights for you;<br />
It is no courage, love, or hate,<br />
But let us do the things we do;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">It's pride that makes the heart be great;</span><br />
It is not anger, no, nor fear&mdash;<br />
Lucasta he's a Fusilier,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And his pride keeps him here.</span>
</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="twofusiliers"></a><h2>TWO FUSILIERS</h2>
<p>And have we done with War at last?<br />
Well, we've been lucky devils both,<br />
And there's no need of pledge or oath<br />
To bind our lovely friendship fast,<br />
By firmer stuff<br />
Close bound enough.</p>
<p>By wire and wood and stake we're bound,<br />
By Fricourt and by Festubert,<br />
By whipping rain, by the sun's glare,<br />
By all the misery and loud sound,<br />
By a Spring day,<br />
By Picard clay.</p>
<p>Show me the two so closely bound<br />
As we, by the red bond of blood,<br />
By friendship, blossoming from mud,<br />
By Death: we faced him, and we found<br />
Beauty in Death,<br />
In dead men breath.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="robertnic"></a><h2>TO ROBERT NICHOLS</h2>
<p>(From Frise on the Somme in February, 1917, in answer<br />
to a letter saying: &quot;I am just finishing my 'Faun's<br />
Holiday.' I wish you were here to feed him with<br />
cherries.&quot;)</p>
<p>Here by a snowbound river<br />
In scrapen holes we shiver,<br />
And like old bitterns we<br />
Boom to you plaintively:<br />
Robert how can I rhyme<br />
Verses for your desire&mdash;<br />
Sleek fauns and cherry-time,<br />
Vague music and green trees,<br />
Hot sun and gentle breeze,<br />
England in June attire,<br />
And life born young again,<br />
For your gay goatish brute<br />
Drunk with warm melody<br />
Singing on beds of thyme<br />
With red and rolling eye,<br />
All the Devonian plain,<br />
Lips dark with juicy stain,<br />
Ears hung with bobbing fruit?<br />
Why should I keep him time?<br />
Why in this cold and rime,<br />
Where even to dream is pain?<br />
No, Robert, there's no reason:<br />
Cherries are out of season,<br />
Ice grips at branch and root,<br />
And singing birds are mute.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="deadcow"></a><h2>DEAD COW FARM</h2>
<p>An ancient saga tells us how<br />
In the beginning the First Cow<br />
(For nothing living yet had birth<br />
But Elemental Cow on earth)<br />
Began to lick cold stones and mud:<br />
Under her warm tongue flesh and blood<br />
Blossomed, a miracle to believe:<br />
And so was Adam born, and Eve.<br />
Here now is chaos once again,<br />
Primeval mud, cold stones and rain.<br />
Here flesh decays and blood drips red,<br />
And the Cow's dead, the old Cow's dead.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="goliath"></a><h2>GOLIATH AND DAVID</h2>
<p>(FOR D.C.T., KILLED AT FRICOURT, MARCH,<br />
1916)</p>
<p>Yet once an earlier David took<br />
Smooth pebbles from the brook:<br />
Out between the lines he went<br />
To that one-sided tournament,<br />
A shepherd boy who stood out fine<br />
And young to fight a Philistine<br />
Clad all in brazen mail. He swears<br />
That he's killed lions, he's killed bears,<br />
And those that scorn the God of Zion<br />
Shall perish so like bear or lion.<br />
But ... the historian of that fight<br />
Had not the heart to tell it right.</p>
<p>Striding within javelin range,<br />
Goliath marvels at this strange<br />
Goodly-faced boy so proud of strength.<br />
David's clear eye measures the length;<br />
With hand thrust back, he cramps one knee,<br />
Poises a moment thoughtfully,<br />
And hurls with a long vengeful swing.<br />
The pebble, humming from the sling<br />
Like a wild bee, flies a sure line<br />
For the forehead of the Philistine;<br />
Then ... but there comes a brazen clink,<br />
And quicker than a man can think<br />
Goliath's shield parries each cast.<br />
Clang! clang! and clang! was David's last.<br />
Scorn blazes in the Giant's eye,<br />
Towering unhurt six cubits high.<br />
Says foolish David, &quot;Damn your shield!<br />
And damn my sling! but I'll not yield.&quot;<br />
He takes his staff of Mamre oak,<br />
A knotted shepherd-staff that's broke<br />
The skull of many a wolf and fox<br />
Come filching lambs from Jesse's flocks.<br />
Loud laughs Goliath, and that laugh<br />
Can scatter chariots like blown chaff<br />
To rout; but David, calm and brave,<br />
Holds his ground, for God will save.<br />
Steel crosses wood, a flash, and oh!<br />
Shame for beauty's overthrow!<br />
(God's eyes are dim, His ears are shut.)<br />
One cruel backhand sabre-cut<br />
&quot;I'm hit! I'm killed!&quot; young David cries,<br />
Throws blindly forward, chokes ... and dies.<br />
And look, spike-helmeted, grey, grim,<br />
Goliath straddles over him.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="babylon"></a><h2>BABYLON</h2>
<p>The child alone a poet is:<br />
Spring and Fairyland are his.<br />
Truth and Reason show but dim,<br />
And all's poetry with him.<br />
Rhyme and music flow in plenty<br />
For the lad of one-and-twenty,<br />
But Spring for him is no more now<br />
Than daisies to a munching cow;<br />
Just a cheery pleasant season,<br />
Daisy buds to live at ease on.<br />
He's forgotten how he smiled<br />
And shrieked at snowdrops when a child,<br />
Or wept one evening secretly<br />
For April's glorious misery.<br />
Wisdom made him old and wary<br />
Banishing the Lords of Faery.<br />
Wisdom made a breach and battered<br />
Babylon to bits: she scattered<br />
To the hedges and ditches<br />
All our nursery gnomes and witches.<br />
Lob and Puck, poor frantic elves,<br />
Drag their treasures from the shelves.<br />
Jack the Giant-killer's gone,<br />
Mother Goose and Oberon,<br />
Bluebeard and King Solomon.<br />
Robin, and Red Riding Hood<br />
Take together to the wood,<br />
And Sir Galahad lies hid<br />
In a cave with Captain Kidd.<br />
None of all the magic hosts,<br />
None remain but a few ghosts<br />
Of timorous heart, to linger on<br />
Weeping for lost Babylon.</p>

<a name="philosopher"></a><h2>MR. PHILOSOPHER</h2>
<p>Old Mr. Philosopher<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Comes for Ben and Claire,</span><br />
An ugly man, a tall man,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">With bright-red hair.</span>
</p>
<p>The books that he's written<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">No one can read.</span><br />
&quot;In fifty years they'll understand:<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Now there's no need.</span>
</p>
<p>&quot;All that matters now<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Is getting the fun.</span><br />
Come along, Ben and Claire;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Plenty to be done.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>Then old Philosopher,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Wisest man alive,</span><br />
Plays at Lions and Tigers<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Down along the drive&mdash;</span>
</p>
<p>Gambolling fiercely<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Through bushes and grass,</span><br />
Making monstrous mouths,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Braying like an ass,</span>
</p>
<p>Twisting buttercups<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">In his orange hair,</span><br />
Hopping like a kangaroo,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Growling like a bear.</span>
</p>
<p>Right up to tea-time<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">They frolic there.</span><br />
&quot;My legs <i>are</i> wingle,&quot;<br />

<a name="cruelmoon"></a><h2>THE CRUEL MOON</h2>
<p>The cruel Moon hangs out of reach<br />
Up above the shadowy beech.<br />
Her face is stupid, but her eye<br />
Is small and sharp and very sly.<br />
Nurse says the Moon can drive you mad?<br />
No, that's a silly story, lad!<br />
Though she be angry, though she would<br />
Destroy all England if she could,<br />
Yet think, what damage can she do<br />
Hanging there so far from you?<br />
Don't heed what frightened nurses say:<br />
Moons hang much too far away.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="finland"></a><h2>FINLAND</h2>
<p>Feet and faces tingle<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">In that frore land:</span><br />
Legs wobble and go wingle,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">You scarce can stand.</span></p>
<p>The skies are jewelled all around,<br />
The ploughshare snaps in the iron ground,<br />
The Finn with face like paper<br />
And eyes like a lighted taper<br />
Hurls his rough rune<br />
At the wintry moon<br />
And stamps to mark the tune.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="pinchsalt"></a><h2>A PINCH OF SALT</h2>
<p>When a dream is born in you<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">With a sudden clamorous pain,</span><br />
When you know the dream is true<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And lovely, with no flaw nor stain,</span><br />
O then, be careful, or with sudden clutch<br />
You'll hurt the delicate thing you prize so much.</p>
<p>Dreams are like a bird that mocks,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Flirting the feathers of his tail.</span><br />
When you seize at the salt-box<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Over the hedge you'll see him sail.</span><br />
Old birds are neither caught with salt nor chaff:<br />
They watch you from the apple bough and laugh.</p>
<p>Poet, never chase the dream.<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Laugh yourself and turn away.</span><br />
Mask your hunger, let it seem<br />
Small matter if he come or stay;<br />
But when he nestles in your hand at last,<br />
Close up your fingers tight and hold him fast.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="caterpillar"></a><h2>THE CATERPILLAR</h2>
<p>Under this loop of honeysuckle,<br />
A creeping, coloured caterpillar,<br />
I gnaw the fresh green hawthorn spray,<br />
I nibble it leaf by leaf away.</p>
<p>Down beneath grow dandelions,<br />
Daisies, old-man's-looking-glasses;<br />
Rooks flap croaking across the lane.<br />
I eat and swallow and eat again.</p>
<p>Here come raindrops helter-skelter;<br />
I munch and nibble unregarding:<br />
Hawthorn leaves are juicy and firm.<br />
I'll mind my business: I'm a good worm.</p>
<p>When I'm old, tired, melancholy,<br />
I'll build a leaf-green mausoleum<br />
Close by, here on this lovely spray,<br />
And die and dream the ages away.</p>
<p>Some say worms win resurrection,<br />
With white wings beating flitter-flutter,<br />
But wings or a sound sleep, why should I care?<br />
Either way I'll miss my share.</p>
<p>Under this loop of honeysuckle,<br />
A hungry, hairy caterpillar,<br />
I crawl on my high and swinging seat,<br />
And eat, eat, eat&mdash;as one ought to eat.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="sorley"></a><h2>SORLEY'S WEATHER</h2>
<p>When outside the icy rain<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Comes leaping helter-skelter,</span><br />
Shall I tie my restive brain<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Snugly under shelter?</span></p>
<p>Shall I make a gentle song<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Here in my firelit study,</span><br />
When outside the winds blow strong<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And the lanes are muddy?</span></p>
<p>With old wine and drowsy meats<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Am I to fill my belly?</span><br />
Shall I glutton here with Keats?<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Shall I drink with Shelley?</span></p>
<p>Tobacco's pleasant, firelight's good:<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Poetry makes both better.</span><br />
Clay is wet and so is mud,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Winter rains are wetter.</span></p>
<p>Yet rest there, Shelley, on the sill,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">For though the winds come frorely,</span><br />
I'm away to the rain-blown hill<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And the ghost of Sorley.</span>

<a name="cottage"></a><h2>THE COTTAGE</h2>
<p>Here in turn succeed and rule<br />
Carter, smith, and village fool,<br />
Then again the place is known<br />
As tavern, shop, and Sunday-school;<br />
Now somehow it's come to me<br />
To light the fire and hold the key,<br />
Here in Heaven to reign alone.</p>
<p>All the walls are white with lime,<br />
Big blue periwinkles climb<br />
And kiss the crumbling window-sill;<br />
Snug inside I sit and rhyme,<br />
Planning, poem, book, or fable,<br />
At my darling beech-wood table<br />
Fresh with bluebells from the hill.</p>
<p>Through the window I can see<br />
Rooks above the cherry-tree,<br />
Sparrows in the violet bed,<br />
Bramble-bush and bumble-bee,<br />
And old red bracken smoulders still<br />
Among boulders on the hill,<br />
Far too bright to seem quite dead.</p>
<p>But old Death, who can't forget,<br />
Waits his time and watches yet,<br />
Waits and watches by the door.<br />
Look, he's got a great new net,<br />
And when my fighting starts afresh<br />
Stouter cord and smaller mesh<br />
Won't be cheated as before.</p>
<p>Nor can kindliness of Spring,<br />
Flowers that smile nor birds that sing.<br />
Bumble-bee nor butterfly,<br />
Nor grassy hill nor anything<br />
Of magic keep me safe to rhyme<br />
In this Heaven beyond my time.<br />
No! for Death is waiting by.</p>

<p>The bugler sent a call of high romance&mdash;<br />
&quot;Lights out! Lights out!&quot; to the deserted square.<br />
On the thin brazen notes he threw a prayer,<br />
&quot;God, if it's <i>this</i> for me next time in France ...<br />
O spare the phantom bugle as I lie<br />
Dead in the gas and smoke and roar of guns,<br />
Dead in a row with the other broken ones<br />
Lying so stiff and still under the sky,<br />
Jolly young Fusiliers too good to die.&quot;</p>

Buried there in Cambrin Wood,<br />
Nor as in Zion think of me<br />
With the Intolerable Good.<br />
And there's one thing that I know well,<br />
I'm damned if I'll be damned to Hell!</p>
<p>So when I'm killed, don't wait for me,<br />
Walking the dim corridor;<br />
In Heaven or Hell, don't wait for me,<br />
Or you must wait for evermore.<br />
You'll find me buried, living-dead<br />
In these verses that you've read.</p>
<p>So when I'm killed, don't mourn for me,<br />
Shot, poor lad, so bold and young,<br />
Killed and gone&mdash;don't mourn for me.<br />
On your lips my life is hung:<br />
O friends and lovers, you can save<br />
Your playfellow from the grave.</p>

<a name="mametzwood"></a><h2>LETTER TO S.S. FROM MAMETZ WOOD</h2>
<p>I never dreamed we'd meet that day<br />
In our old haunts down Fricourt way,<br />
Plotting such marvellous journeys there<br />
For jolly old &quot;Apr&egrave;s-la-guerre.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, when it's over, first we'll meet<br />
At Gweithdy Bach, my country seat<br />
In Wales, a curious little shop<br />
With two rooms and a roof on top,<br />
A sort of Morlancourt-ish billet<br />
That never needs a crowd to fill it.<br />
But oh, the country round about!<br />
The sort of view that makes you shout<br />
For want of any better way<br />
Of praising God: there's a blue bay<br />
Shining in front, and on the right<br />
Snowden and Hebog capped with white,<br />
And lots of other jolly peaks<br />
That you could wonder at for weeks,<br />
With jag and spur and hump and cleft.<br />
There's a grey castle on the left,<br />
And back in the high Hinterland<br />
You'll see the grave of Shawn Knarlbrand,<br />
Who slew the savage Buffaloon<br />
By the Nant-col one night in June,<br />
And won his surname from the horn<br />
Of this prodigious unicorn.<br />
Beyond, where the two Rhinogs tower,<br />
Rhinog Fach and Rhinog Fawr,<br />
Close there after a four years' chase<br />
From Thessaly and the woods of Thrace,<br />
The beaten Dog-cat stood at bay<br />
And growled and fought and passed away.<br />
You'll see where mountain conies grapple<br />
With prayer and creed in their rock chapel<br />
Which Ben and Claire once built for them;<br />
They call it S&ouml;ar Bethlehem.<br />
You'll see where in old Roman days,<br />
Before Revivals changed our ways,<br />
The Virgin 'scaped the Devil's grab,<br />
Printing her foot on a stone slab<br />
With five clear toe-marks; and you'll find<br />
The fiendish thumbprint close behind.<br />
You'll see where Math, Mathonwy's son,<br />
Spoke with the wizard Gwydion<br />
And bad him from South Wales set out<br />
To steal that creature with the snout,<br />
That new-discovered grunting beast<br />
Divinely flavoured for the feast.<br />
No traveller yet has hit upon<br />
A wilder land than Meirion,<br />
For desolate hills and tumbling stones,<br />
Bogland and melody and old bones.<br />
Fairies and ghosts are here galore,<br />
And poetry most splendid, more<br />
Than can be written with the pen<br />
Or understood by common men.</p>
<p>In Gweithdy Bach we'll rest awhile,<br />
We'll dress our wounds and learn to smile<br />
With easier lips; we'll stretch our legs,<br />
And live on bilberry tart and eggs,<br />
And store up solar energy,<br />
Basking in sunshine by the sea,<br />
Until we feel a match once more<br />
For <i>anything</i> but another war.</p>
<p>So then we'll kiss our families,<br />
And sail across the seas<br />
(The God of Song protecting us)<br />
To the great hills of Caucasus.<br />
Robert will learn the local <i>bat</i><br />
For billeting and things like that,<br />
If Siegfried learns the piccolo<br />
To charm the people as we go.</p>
<p>The jolly peasants clad in furs<br />
Will greet the Welch-ski officers<br />
With open arms, and ere we pass<br />
Will make us vocal with Kavasse.<br />
In old Bagdad we'll call a halt<br />
At the S&acirc;shuns' ancestral vault;<br />
We'll catch the Persian rose-flowers' scent,<br />
And understand what Omar meant.<br />
Bitlis and Mush will know our faces,<br />
Tiflis and Tomsk, and all such places.<br />
Perhaps eventually we'll get<br />
Among the Tartars of Thibet.<br />
Hobnobbing with the Chungs and Mings,<br />
And doing wild, tremendous things<br />
In free adventure, quest and fight,<br />
And God! what poetry we'll write!</p>

A certain cure for lust of blood:</p>
<p>Where, propped against a shattered trunk,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">In a great mess of things unclean,</span><br />
Sat a dead Boche; he scowled and stunk<br />

&quot;They drank my holy brook,<br />
My strawberries they took,<br />
My private path they trod.&quot;<br />

<a name="shiver"></a><h2>THE SHIVERING BEGGAR</h2>
<p>Near Clapham village, where fields began,<br />
Saint Edward met a beggar man.<br />
It was Christmas morning, the church bells tolled,<br />
The old man trembled for the fierce cold.</p>
<p>Saint Edward cried, &quot;It is monstrous sin<br />
A beggar to lie in rags so thin!<br />
An old grey-beard and the frost so keen:<br />
I shall give him my fur-lined gaberdine.&quot;</p>
<p>He stripped off his gaberdine of scarlet<br />
And wrapped it round the aged varlet,<br />
Who clutched at the folds with a muttered curse,<br />
Quaking and chattering seven times worse.</p>
<p>Said Edward, &quot;Sir, it would seem you freeze<br />
Most bitter at your extremities.<br />
Here are gloves and shoes and stockings also,<br />
That warm upon your way you may go.&quot;</p>
<p>The man took stocking and shoe and glove,<br />
Blaspheming Christ our Saviour's love,<br />
Yet seemed to find but little relief,<br />
Shaking and shivering like a leaf.</p>
<p>Said the saint again, &quot;I have no great riches,<br />
Yet take this tunic, take these breeches,<br />
My shirt and my vest, take everything,<br />
And give due thanks to Jesus the King.&quot;</p>
<p>The saint stood naked upon the snow<br />
Long miles from where he was lodged at Bowe,<br />
Praying, &quot;O God! my faith, it grows faint!<br />
This would try the temper of any saint.</p>
<p>&quot;Make clean my heart, Almighty, I pray,<br />
And drive these sinful thoughts away.<br />
Make clean my heart if it be Thy will,<br />
This damned old rascal's shivering still!&quot;</p>
<p>He stooped, he touched the beggar man's shoulder;<br />
He asked him did the frost nip colder?<br />
&quot;Frost!&quot; said the beggar, &quot;no, stupid lad!<br />
'Tis the palsy makes me shiver so bad.&quot;</p>

<a name="jonah"></a><h2>JONAH</h2>
<p>A purple whale<br />
Proudly sweeps his tail<br />
Towards Nineveh;<br />
Glassy green<br />
Surges between<br />
A mile of roaring sea.</p>
<p>&quot;O town of gold,<br />
Of splendour multifold,<br />
Lucre and lust,<br />
Leviathan's eye<br />
Can surely spy<br />
Thy doom of death and dust.&quot;</p>
<p>On curving sands<br />
Vengeful Jonah stands.<br />
&quot;Yet forty days,<br />
Then down, down,<br />
Tumbles the town<br />
In flaming ruin ablaze.&quot;</p>
<p>With swift lament<br />
Those Ninevites repent.<br />
They cry in tears,<br />
&quot;Our hearts fail!<br />
The whale, the whale!<br />
Our sins prick us like spears.&quot;</p>
<p>Jonah is vexed;<br />
He cries, &quot;What next? what next?&quot;<br />
And shakes his fist.<br />
&quot;Stupid city,<br />
The shame, the pity,<br />
The glorious crash I've missed.&quot;</p>

Off ploughs the purple whale,<br />

<p>What could be dafter<br />
Than John Skelton's laughter?<br />
What sound more tenderly<br />
Than his pretty poetry?<br />
So where to rank old Skelton?<br />
He was no monstrous Milton,<br />
Nor wrote no &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot;<br />
So wondered at by most,<br />
Phrased so disdainfully,<br />
Composed so painfully.<br />
He struck what Milton missed,<br />
Milling an English grist<br />
With homely turn and twist.<br />
He was English through and through,<br />
Not Greek, nor French, nor Jew,<br />
Though well their tongues he knew,<br />
The living and the dead:<br />
Learned Erasmus said,<br />
<i>Hie 'unum Britannicarum<br />
Lumen et decus literarum.</i><br />
But oh, Colin Clout!<br />
How his pen flies about,<br />
Twiddling and turning,<br />
Scorching and burning,<br />
Thrusting and thrumming!<br />
How it hurries with humming,<br />
Leaping and running,<br />
At the tipsy-topsy Tunning<br />
Of Mistress Eleanor Rumming!<br />
How for poor Philip Sparrow<br />
Was murdered at Carow,<br />
How our hearts he does harrow<br />
Jest and grief mingle<br />
In this jangle-jingle,<br />
For he will not stop<br />
To sweep nor mop,<br />
To prune nor prop,<br />
To cut each phrase up<br />
Like beef when we sup,<br />
Nor sip at each line<br />
As at brandy-wine,<br />
Or port when we dine.<br />
But angrily, wittily,<br />
Tenderly, prettily,<br />
Laughingly, learnedly,<br />
Sadly, madly,<br />
Helter-skelter John<br />
Rhymes serenely on,<br />
As English poets should.<br />
Old John, you do me good!</p>

<p>Look at my knees,<br />
That island rising from the steamy seas!<br />
The candles a tall lightship; my two hands<br />
Are boats and barges anchored to the sands,<br />
With mighty cliffs all round;<br />
They're full of wine and riches from far lands....<br />
<i>I wonder what it feels like to be drowned?</i></p>
<p>I can make caves,<br />
By lifting up the island and huge waves<br />
And storms, and then with head and ears well under<br />
Blow bubbles with a monstrous roar like thunder,<br />
A bull-of-Bashan sound.<br />
The seas run high and the boats split asunder....<br />
<i>I wonder what it feels like to be drowned?</i></p>
<p>The thin soap slips<br />
And slithers like a shark under the ships.<br />
My toes are on the soap-dish&mdash;that's the effect<br />
Of my huge storms; an iron steamer's wrecked.<br />
The soap slides round and round;<br />

What need have I of magic charms&mdash;<br />
'Abracadabra!' and 'Prestopuff'?<br />
I have but to wish, and that is enough.<br />
The charms are vain, one wish is enough.<br />
My master pledged my hand to a wizard;<br />

<p>PHILOSOPHER<br />
Small friend, with prayer and meditation<br />
I make an image of Creation.<br />
And if your mind is working nimble<br />
Straightway you'll recognize a symbol<br />
Of the endless and eternal ring<br />
Of God, who girdles everything&mdash;<br />
God, who in His own form and plan<br />
Moulds the fugitive life of man.<br />
These vaporous toys you watch me make,<br />
That shoot ahead, pause, turn and break&mdash;<br />
Some glide far out like sailing ships,<br />
Some weak ones fail me at my lips.<br />

<a name="nightmare"></a><h2>A CHILD'S NIGHTMARE</h2>
<p>Through long nursery nights he stood<br />
By my bed unwearying,<br />
Loomed gigantic, formless, queer,<br />
Purring in my haunted ear<br />
That same hideous nightmare thing,<br />
Talking, as he lapped my blood,<br />
In a voice cruel and flat,<br />
Saying&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cat! ... Cat! ... Cat! ...&quot;</p>
<p>That one word was all he said,<br />
That one word through all my sleep,<br />
In monotonous mock despair.<br />
Nonsense may be light as air,<br />
But there's Nonsense that can keep<br />
Horror bristling round the head,<br />
When a voice cruel and flat<br />
Says for ever, &quot;Cat! ... Cat! ... Cat!...&quot;</p>
<p>He had faded, he was gone<br />
Years ago with Nursery Land<br />
When he leapt on me again<br />
From the clank of a night train,<br />
Overpowered me foot and head,<br />
Lapped my blood, while on and on<br />
The old voice cruel and flat<br />
Says for ever, &quot;Cat!... Cat!... Cat!...&quot;</p>
<p>Morphia drowsed, again I lay<br />
In a crater by High Wood:<br />
He was there with straddling legs,<br />
Staring eyes as big as eggs,<br />
Purring as he lapped my blood,<br />
His black bulk darkening the day,<br />
With a voice cruel and flat,<br />
&quot;Cat!... Cat!... Cat!...&quot; he said,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">&quot;Cat!... Cat!...&quot;</span></p>
<p>When I'm shot through heart and head,<br />
And there's no choice but to die,<br />
The last word I'll hear, no doubt,<br />
Won't be &quot;Charge!&quot; or &quot;Bomb them out!&quot;<br />
Nor the stretcher-bearer's cry,<br />
&quot;Let that body be, he's dead!&quot;<br />
But a voice cruel and flat<br />
Saying for ever, &quot;Cat!... Cat!... Cat!&quot;</p>

<p>(<i>August</i> 6, 1916.&mdash;Officer previously reported died of<br />
wounds, now reported wounded: Graves, Captain R.,<br />
Royal Welch Fusiliers.)<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.25em;">... But I <i>was</i> dead, an hour or more.</span><br />
I woke when I'd already passed the door<br />
That Cerberus guards, and half-way down the road<br />
To Lethe, as an old Greek signpost showed.<br />
Above me, on my stretcher swinging by,<br />
I saw new stars in the subterrene sky:<br />
A Cross, a Rose in bloom, a Cage with bars,<br />
And a barbed Arrow feathered in fine stars.<br />
I felt the vapours of forgetfulness<br />
Float in my nostrils. Oh, may Heaven bless<br />
Dear Lady Proserpine, who saw me wake,<br />
And, stooping over me, for Henna's sake<br />
Cleared my poor buzzing head and sent me back<br />
Breathless, with leaping heart along the track.<br />
After me roared and clattered angry hosts<br />
Of demons, heroes, and policeman-ghosts.<br />
&quot;Life! life! I can't be dead! I won't be dead!<br />
Damned if I'll die for any one!&quot; I said....<br />
Cerberus stands and grins above me now,<br />
Wearing three heads&mdash;lion, and lynx, and sow.<br />
&quot;Quick, a revolver! But my Webley's gone,<br />
Stolen!... No bombs ... no knife....<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The crowd swarms on,</span><br />
Bellows, hurls stones.... Not even a honeyed sop ...<br />
Nothing.... Good Cerberus!... Good dog!... but stop!<br />
Stay!... A great luminous thought ... I do believe<br />
There's still some morphia that I bought on leave.&quot;<br />
Then swiftly Cerberus' wide mouths I cram<br />
With army biscuit smeared with ration jam;</p>

<p>And sleep lurks in the luscious plum and apple.<br />
He crunches, swallows, stiffens, seems to grapple<br />
With the all-powerful poppy ... then a snore,<br />
A crash; the beast blocks up the corridor<br />
With monstrous hairy carcase, red and dun&mdash;<br />
Too late! for I've sped through.<br />

<a name="nonsense"></a><h2>THE BOUGH OF NONSENSE</h2><br />
An Idyll<p></p>
<p>Back from the Somme two Fusiliers<br />
Limped painfully home; the elder said,<br />
<i>S</i>. &quot;Robert, I've lived three thousand years<br />
This Summer, and I'm nine parts dead.&quot;<br />
<i>R</i>. &quot;But if that's truly so,&quot; I cried, &quot;quick, now,<br />
Through these great oaks and see the famous bough</p>
<p>&quot;Where once a nonsense built her nest<br />
With skulls and flowers and all things queer,<br />
In an old boot, with patient breast<br />
Hatching three eggs; and the next year ...&quot;<br />
<i>S</i>. &quot;Foaled thirteen squamous young beneath, and rid<br />
Wales of drink, melancholy, and psalms, she did.&quot;</p>
<p>Said he, &quot;Before this quaint mood fails,<br />
We'll sit and weave a nonsense hymn,&quot;<br />
<i>R</i>. &quot;Hanging it up with monkey tails<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">In a deep grove all hushed and dim....&quot;</span><br />
<i>S</i>. &quot;To glorious yellow-bunched banana-trees,&quot;<br />
<i>R</i>. &quot;Planted in dreams by pious Portuguese,&quot;</p>
<p><i>S</i>. &quot;Which men are wise beyond their time,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And worship nonsense, no one more.&quot;</span><br />
<i>R</i>. &quot;Hard by, among old quince and lime,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">They've built a temple with no floor,&quot;</span><br />
<i>S</i>. &quot;And whosoever worships in that place,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">He disappears from sight and leaves no trace.&quot;</span></p>
<p><i>R</i>. &quot;Once the Galatians built a fane<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">To Sense: what duller God than that?&quot;</span><br />
<i>S</i>. &quot;But the first day of autumn rain<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The roof fell in and crushed them flat.&quot;</span><br />
<i>R</i>. &quot;Ay, for a roof of subtlest logic falls<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">When nonsense is foundation for the walls.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p>I tell him old Galatian tales;<br />
He caps them in quick Portuguese,<br />
While phantom creatures with green scales<br />
Scramble and roll among the trees.<br />
The hymn swells; on a bough above us sings<br />
A row of bright pink birds, flapping their wings.</p>

<a name="notdead"></a><h2>NOT DEAD</h2>
<p>Walking through trees to cool my heat and pain,<br />
I know that David's with me here again.<br />
All that is simple, happy, strong, he is.<br />
Caressingly I stroke<br />
Rough hark of the friendly oak.<br />
A brook goes bubbling by: the voice is his.<br />
Turf burns with pleasant smoke;<br />
I laugh at chaffinch and at primroses.<br />
All that is simple, happy, strong, he is.<br />
Over the whole wood in a little while<br />
Breaks his slow smile.</p>

<a name="church"></a><h2>A BOY IN CHURCH</h2>
<p>&quot;Gabble-gabble,... brethren,... gabble-gabble!&quot;<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">My window frames forest and heather.</span><br />
I hardly hear the tuneful babble,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Not knowing nor much caring whether</span><br />
The text is praise or exhortation,<br />
Prayer or thanksgiving, or damnation.</p>
<p>Outside it blows wetter and wetter,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The tossing trees never stay still.</span><br />
I shift my elbows to catch better<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">The full round sweep of heathered hill.</span><br />
The tortured copse bends to and fro<br />
In silence like a shadow-show.</p>
<p>The parson's voice runs like a river<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Over smooth rocks. I like this church:</span><br />
The pews are staid, they never shiver,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">They never bend or sway or lurch.</span><br />
&quot;Prayer,&quot; says the kind voice, &quot;is a chain<br />
That draws down Grace from Heaven again.&quot;</p>
<p>I add the hymns up, over and over,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">Until there's not the least mistake.</span><br />
Seven-seventy-one. (Look! there's a plover!<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">It's gone!)&nbsp;&nbsp;Who's that Saint by the lake?</span><br />
The red light from his mantle passes<br />
Across the broad memorial brasses.</p>
<p>It's pleasant here for dreams and thinking,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">Lolling and letting reason nod,</span><br />
With ugly serious people linking<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.75em;">Sad prayers to a forgiving God....</span><br />
But a dumb blast sets the trees swaying<br />
With furious zeal like madmen praying.</p>

<a name="corporal"></a><h2>CORPORAL STARE</h2>
<p>Back from the line one night in June,<br />
I gave a dinner at Bethune&mdash;<br />
Seven courses, the most gorgeous meal<br />
Money could buy or batman steal.<br />
Five hungry lads welcomed the fish<br />
With shouts that nearly cracked the dish;<br />
Asparagus came with tender tops,<br />
Strawberries in cream, and mutton chops.<br />
Said Jenkins, as my hand he shook,<br />
&quot;They'll put this in the history book.&quot;<br />
We bawled Church anthems <i>in choro</i><br />
Of Bethlehem and Hermon snow,<br />
With drinking songs, a jolly sound<br />
To help the good red Pommard round.<br />
Stories and laughter interspersed,<br />
We drowned a long La Bass&eacute;e thirst&mdash;<br />
Trenches in June make throats damned dry.<br />
Then through the window suddenly,<br />
Badge, stripes and medals all complete,<br />
We saw him swagger up the street,<br />
Just like a live man&mdash;Corporal Stare!<br />
Stare! Killed last May at Festubert.<br />
Caught on patrol near the Boche wire,<br />
Tom horribly by machine-gun fire!<br />
He paused, saluted smartly, grinned,<br />
Then passed away like a puff of wind,<br />
Leaving us blank astonishment.<br />
The song broke, up we started, leant<br />
Out of the window&mdash;nothing there,<br />
Not the least shadow of Corporal Stare,<br />
Only a quiver of smoke that showed<br />
A fag-end dropped on the silent road.</p>
<hr style="width: 35%;" />
<a name="heroic"></a><h2>THE ASSAULT HEROIC</h2>
<p>Down in the mud I lay,<br />
Tired out by my long day<br />
Of five damned days and nights,<br />
Five sleepless days and nights, ...<br />
Dream-snatched, and set me where<br />
The dungeon of Despair<br />
Looms over Desolate Sea,<br />
Frowning and threatening me<br />
With aspect high and steep&mdash;<br />
A most malignant keep.<br />
My foes that lay within<br />
Shouted and made a din,<br />
Hooted and grinned and cried:<br />
&quot;Today we've killed your pride;<br />
Today your ardour ends.<br />
We've murdered all your friends;<br />
We've undermined by stealth<br />
Your happiness and your health.<br />
We've taken away your hope;<br />
Now you may droop and mope<br />
To misery and to Death.&quot;<br />
But with my spear of Faith,<br />
Stout as an oaken rafter,<br />
With my round shield of laughter,<br />
With my sharp, tongue-like sword<br />
That speaks a bitter word,<br />
I stood beneath the wall<br />
And there defied them all.<br />
The stones they cast I caught<br />
And alchemized with thought<br />
Into such lumps of gold<br />
As dreaming misers hold.<br />
The boiling oil they threw<br />
Fell in a shower of dew,<br />
Refreshing me; the spears<br />
Flew harmless by my ears,<br />
Struck quivering in the sod;<br />
There, like the prophet's rod,<br />
Put leaves out, took firm root,<br />
And bore me instant fruit.<br />
My foes were all astounded,<br />
Dumbstricken and confounded,<br />
Gaping in a long row;<br />
They dared not thrust nor throw.<br />
Thus, then, I climbed a steep<br />
Buttress and won the keep,<br />
And laughed and proudly blew<br />
My horn, <i>&quot;Stand to! Stand to!<br />
Wake up, sir! Here's a new<br />
Attack! Stand to! Stand to!&quot;</i></p>

<a name="poetnursery"></a><h2>THE POET IN THE NURSERY</h2>
<p>The youngest poet down the shelves was fumbling<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">In a dim library, just behind the chair</span><br />
From which the ancient poet was mum-mumbling<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">A song about some Lovers at a Fair,</span><br />
Pulling his long white beard and gently grumbling<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">That rhymes were beastly things and never there.</span></p>
<p>And as I groped, the whole time I was thinking<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">About the tragic poem I'd been writing,...</span><br />
An old man's life of beer and whisky drinking,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">His years of kidnapping and wicked fighting;</span><br />
And how at last, into a fever sinking,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Remorsefully he died, his bedclothes biting.</span></p>
<p>But suddenly I saw the bright green cover<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Of a thin pretty book right down below;</span><br />
I snatched it up and turned the pages over,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">To find it full of poetry, and so</span><br />
Put it down my neck with quick hands like a lover,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">And turned to watch if the old man saw it go.</span></p>
<p>The book was full of funny muddling mazes,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Each rounded off into a lovely song,</span><br />
And most extraordinary and monstrous phrases<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Knotted with rhymes like a slave-driver's thong.</span><br />
And metre twisting like a chain of daisies<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">With great big splendid words a sentence long.</span></p>
<p>I took the book to bed with me and gloated,<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Learning the lines that seemed to sound most grand;</span><br />
So soon the pretty emerald green was coated<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">With jam and greasy marks from my hot hand,</span><br />
While round the nursery for long months there floated<br />
<span style="layout-flow: horizontal; margin-left: 0.5em;">Wonderful words no one could understand.</span>

Thirsting and hungering,<br />

That listened wondering.<br />

From ruined palace-wall,<br />
Answered them brotherly.<br />
He held communion<br />
With the she-pelican<br />
Of lonely piety.<br />
Basilisk, cockatrice,<br />
Flocked to his homilies,<br />
With mail of dread device,<br />
With monstrous barb&eacute;d slings,<br />
With eager dragon-eyes;<br />
Great rats on leather wings<br />
And poor blind broken things,<br />
Foul in their miseries.<br />
And ever with Him went,<br />
Of all His wanderings<br />
Comrade, with ragged coat,<br />
Gaunt ribs&mdash;poor innocent&mdash;<br />
Bleeding foot, burning throat,<br />

If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

Gutenberg-tm License.

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
